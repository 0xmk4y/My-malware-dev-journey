#Well today i decided not to copy and paste others code to run my shellcode.

The code above bacically shows the fundamentals of how malware dev are able to create shellcode and then allocate certrain area in memory to run this shellcode

This is the process i followed

1. First of all we generate our shellcode using msfvenom (shellcode to run calc.exe in windows)
 
msfvenom -f c -p windows/x64/exec cmd="C:\windows\system32\calc.exe"

2. We allocate a portion of memory to hold shellocde for execution using Virtualalloc function from windows.h file

3. Used the memcpy function to copy our shellocde to the area of memory we allocaated

4. We create a thread to run our shellcode using CreateThread function

5. We wait for the shellcode to finist executing before exiting our code with the help of WaitForSingleObject function

6. finally we free the area of memory we allocated for the shellcode

Then we compile our program

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -o TestCalc.exe main.cpp -fpermissive -Wno-narrowing
